# AI Playground Project

## Overview
This is a multi-AI workflow test project where Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Grok CLI work together on the same codebase.

## Project Structure
- Root directory for experimentation and testing multi-AI workflows

## Guidelines
- All AI tools share this context
- Coordinate work to avoid conflicts
- Each AI has strengths:
  - **Claude Code**: Deep analysis, long-form writing, specialized agents
  - **Gemini CLI**: Fast web research, current info, quick iterations
  - **Grok CLI**: Real-time X/Twitter data, different perspective

## Current Tasks
- Setting up multi-AI workflow environment
